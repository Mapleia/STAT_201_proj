## Introductions

Wildfires are a dangerous and incredibly destructive phenomenon of nature, which makes understanding and predicting them perimount to curbing their destructive potential in the future. However, there are innumerable factors to consider when trying to predict the effects of a wildfire. Of the two “most important” factors in how wildfires are spread, wind speed is “the most variable and the least predictable.” However, in spite of its variability, its predictive power is immense. So much so that there exists a simple “10% rule” that approximates a wildfire's rate of spread simply through “10% of the average 10-m open wind speed.” This simple model can produce results “comparable to those obtained by the established fire spread rate models” while only accounting for the wind speed factor.

For our project we aim to put the literature to the test and see just how powerful a factor wind speed truly is for ourselves. We aim to answer the question “What is the difference in average total area burned by a wildfire between times of low wind speed and times of high wind speed?” We would also like to approximate the standard deviation of this difference to see if the results are consistently statistically significant. To answer our question, we have made use of a dataset containing data of the total area burned from 517 forest fires in the northeastern region of Portugal. This dataset also includes the wind speed among other less relevant variables.
