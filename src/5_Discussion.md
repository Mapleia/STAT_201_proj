# Discussion

We used a simulation based approach to calculate a 95% confidence interval of between -0.143 and 0.0766 Hectare. Even considering that we scaled the data by log base 10, this is still a pretty small interval in the context of Hectare area burned (a Hectare is 100 meters by 100 meters). This suggests that there was relatively little variation between the bootstrap samples and that we had a sufficiently large dataset to produce such a narrow interval. 

Continuing to the hypothesis tests we can see that we produced the p values of 0.578 and 0.579 for the simulation and theory based approaches respectively. This means that under our null model, we would have a probability of 0.578/0.579 of seeing a statistic equal or more extreme than our observed statistic of -0.0301. These very large p values would thus lead us to not reject the null hypothesis that the two wind speed categories had equal average areas burned. 

Analysing prior research, our results are certainly not what we were expecting. Our preliminary results did show signs that there would be little difference between the groups, however there was an expectation that the proper magnitude of the results would be put into perspective when they were examined through the hypothesis tests. However, now with the benefits of hindsight, those previous results seem a lot more reasonable as they coincided with our lack of evidence to reject the null hypothesis with.

Our findings suggest that wind speed does not have a significant effect on the area burned during a forest fire. This directly contradicts the prior research so this might be an indicator that there might be a need for an alternative approach. For example, variables like temperature, humidity, and geographic location could be more significant variables in analyzing wildfires. Knowing what factors play a significant role can help us to identify areas that might be more prone to forest fires and then reduce the risk of forest fires by controlling said variables.
